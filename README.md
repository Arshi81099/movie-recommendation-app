# Project README

## Overview
This project includes a frontend application built with npm, a backend system with Celery for task scheduling, Redis as a message broker, and a Python application. This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the development environment.

## Prerequisites
1. Vue.js and npm (for frontend)
2. Python 3.x
3. Redis
4. Celery
5. Python packages (Flask)


## Setup

## Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    cd path/to/frontend

2. Install the necessary npm packages:
    npm install

3. Run the frontend application:
    npm run dev

## Backend Setup
1. Start the Redis server:
    redis-server
2. Start Celery Beat (task scheduler):
    celery -A app.celery beat --max-interval 1 -l info
3. Start Celery Worker (task executor):
    celery -A app.celery worker -l info
4. Run the Python application:
    python app.py

## Project Structure
1. Frontend: The directory containing the frontend code and configuration.
2. Backend: Includes Celery configurations, task definitions, and Redis setup.
3. Python Application: The main application logic, typically including routing and business logic.
Troubleshooting
4. Celery Issues: Ensure that both Celery Beat and Celery Worker are running in separate terminal windows. Check the logs for any errors.
5. Redis Issues: Make sure the Redis server is running and accessible.
6. Frontend Issues: Verify that all npm dependencies are correctly installed and check the console for any errors.
