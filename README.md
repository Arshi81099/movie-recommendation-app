Project README
Overview
This project includes a frontend application built with npm, a backend system with Celery for task scheduling, Redis as a message broker, and a Python application. This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the development environment.

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (for frontend)
Python 3.x
Redis
Celery
Python packages (e.g., Flask, Django, etc. depending on your app)
Setup
1. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:


cd path/to/frontend
Install the necessary npm packages:


npm install
Run the frontend application:


npm run dev
2. Backend Setup
Start the Redis server:


redis-server
Start Celery Beat (task scheduler):


celery -A app.celery beat --max-interval 1 -l info
Start Celery Worker (task executor):


celery -A app.celery worker -l info
Run the Python application:


python app.py
Project Structure
Frontend: The directory containing the frontend code and configuration.
Backend: Includes Celery configurations, task definitions, and Redis setup.
Python Application: The main application logic, typically including routing and business logic.
Troubleshooting
Celery Issues: Ensure that both Celery Beat and Celery Worker are running in separate terminal windows. Check the logs for any errors.
Redis Issues: Make sure the Redis server is running and accessible.
Frontend Issues: Verify that all npm dependencies are correctly installed and check the console for any errors.
